# Gridworld-zero-reward
### Project for the Reinforcement Learning PhD exam.
In this project I will rebuild and analyze the gridworld example from https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning assigning zero reward instead of -1 for each step, and assignin a positive reward when ending on one of the two terminal states to see what happens.
